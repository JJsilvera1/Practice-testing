An incomplete catalog of information assets introduces the possibility that prioritization is overlooking assets that may have substantial value, unintentionally resulting in the implicit acceptance of risk that may exceed the risk appetite and tolerance. However, inaccurate valuation of known assets has a greater negative impact on prioritization than the possibility of certain high-value assets not being properly taken into account.",
            "B": "Evaluating the threat environment is the most challenging aspect of risk assessment, and it is nearly always the case that a threat assessment excludes one or more threats. As a result, any prioritization effort must assume that the threat assessment is not comprehensive.",
            "C": "It is common for a vulnerability assessment to be outdated at the start of each cycle of a risk management program prior to the start of risk management activities, but the influence of outdated vulnerability information is less a concern than inaccurate valuation of assets.",
